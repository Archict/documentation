# Main page

The main concept of Archict is the [Brick](../documentation/brick.md). The project itself is a Brick and comes with a first class named `Application`. This class is loaded by Archict and has only one role: create the 2 routes we seen previously (see more in [Routing](../documentation/routing.md)). The one which interest us now is the first one create with this line:

```php
$collector->addRoute(Method::GET, '', new HomeController($this->twig));
```

It tells to Archict that we want to listen empty path on `GET` method and use an instance of `HomeController` as the handler. So now let's see this famous handler.

First thing to notice is that the class implements interface `RequestHandler`. This interface is provided by the Brick [Archict/Router](../bricks/router.md) and is mandatory to create a handler. It just needs one method: `public function handle(ServerRequestInterface $request): ResponseInterface|string`. In our case we simply returns a `string` generated by Twig rendering.

Let's just simplify it with what we need:

```php
public function handle(ServerRequestInterface $request): string
{
    return $this->twig->render('home.html.twig');
}
```

And now let go see this template file and also fill it with what we need:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My super blog!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My super blog!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the best blog of the galaxy</p>
</body>
</html>
```
